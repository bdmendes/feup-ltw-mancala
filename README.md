# feup-ltw-mancala

An online Mancala game platform. Project for Web Languages and Technologies, FEUP.

## Project status

### Part 1

Complete implementation of game logic and frontend, including the Minimax algorithm and the Canvas and WebStorage APIs.

### Part 2

Complete implementation of server requests to the TW Server, allowing for online gaming.

### Part 3

Incomplete implementation of own server: routing, static files serving and register/ranking methods. Since this was not completed, the client will request the TW Server for multiplayer online games, whose availability is not guaranteed.

## How to run

Run `index.js` with `node` to launch the server on `localhost:9109`.

Alternatively, give it a quick try via https://bdmendes.github.io/feup-ltw-mancala/.
